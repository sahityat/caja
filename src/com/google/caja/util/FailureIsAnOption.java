/**
 * Marks a test that is known to fail.
 * It is appropriate to use this in several cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To document a bug with a test case before fixing it.</li>
 * <li>To allow a change to commit while coordinating overlapping changes with
 *     another person who has a pending fix.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Known failing tests will be identified in the test reports, but will not
 * cause the build to fail, and so won't stop {@code myvn submit}.
