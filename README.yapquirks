YAP temporary quirks that shouldn't propagate upstream.

* YAP currently uses <base> in the sandbox as part of
  the URL policy, and to accommodate that we need to
  neuter some of Caja's restrictions:

    * Caja prevents <form> from navigating the page,
      by preventing the default form submit action.
      We want to allow the default form submit action.

    * Caja rewrites the @target attribute to disallow
      the default target.  We want to allow the default
      target.
